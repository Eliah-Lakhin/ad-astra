# Web Assembly

The Ad Astra crate supports WebAssembly (Wasm) build targets, specifically the
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

The compiled Wasm module can be loaded and run in browsers, including the script
language static analyzer, runner, and language server. However, this setup
requires additional preparations.

The [WebAssembly Example](https://github.com/Eliah-Lakhin/ad-astra/tree/master/work/examples/wasm)
provides a full-featured setup of these components for the browser environment.
You can see it in action in the [Ad Astra Playground](../playground.md).

## Exports

For desktop build targets, the `Export` macro automatically exports
introspection metadata by linking the generated exporting functions in a special
link section.

However, the Wasm build target does not have a fully-featured linker. Therefore,
you must call these functions manually after the Wasm module is loaded and
before the module is actually used.

```javascript
// Loading a WebAssembly file.
const assembly = fetch('./wasm.wasm');

// Compiling the file in the browser.
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(assembly, IMPORTS).then(({instance}) => {
    // Calling each module-exported function that starts with the special
    // `__ADASTRA_EXPORT_` prefix.
    //
    // These functions are generated by the Export macro.
    // By invoking them manually, you register the corresponding item's
    // introspection metadata in the Ad Astra script engine's exports registry.
    for (const property in instance.exports) {
        if (property.startsWith('__ADASTRA_EXPORT_')) {
            instance.exports[property]();
        }
    }

    // The module is now ready for use.
});
```

## LSP Server

The built-in LSP server that you would normally run using the
[LspServer::startup](https://docs.rs/ad-astra/1.0.0/ad_astra/server/struct.LspServer.html#method.startup)
function spawns additional threads for the communication channel and the actual
LSP server instance.

Common LSP communication transports such as STDIO and TCP are unavailable in the
Wasm environment. Additionally, the browser's Wasm environment does not support
multi-threading.

To organize the LSP server in this environment, you would typically instantiate
the LSP server manually using the
[LspServer::new](https://docs.rs/ad-astra/1.0.0/ad_astra/server/struct.LspServer.html#method.new)
function and manually manage communication between the language server and the
language client.

The [WebAssembly Example](https://github.com/Eliah-Lakhin/ad-astra/tree/master/work/examples/wasm)
example demonstrates running the Wasm module in a separate web worker,
establishing communication through a system of serialized post-messages passed
between the worker and the browser environment.

The [LspServer::handle](https://docs.rs/ad-astra/1.0.0/ad_astra/server/struct.LspServer.html#method.handle)
function processes deserialized incoming LSP messages, synchronously yielding
outgoing messages. The corresponding implementation reads these messages on the
Rust side, serializes them into strings, and sends these strings back to the
browser environment.
