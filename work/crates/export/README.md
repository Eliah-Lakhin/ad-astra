# Ad Astra Macros Crate

This is a helper crate for the [main crate](https://crates.io/crates/ad-astra)
of Ad Astra, an embeddable scripting programming language platform.

The `#[export]` attribute macro in this crate performs introspection of Rust
module items and exports the introspected metadata into the Ad Astra
script engine, allowing script users to interact with Rust APIs from their
scripts.
